# Anti-gravity

Google Anti-gravity is the first agent-first AI-powered IDE designed to transform developer workflows through autonomous agents that plan, execute, and verify software tasks. Built as a fork of VS Code, it provides familiar editing experience enhanced with revolutionary AI agent capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Agent-Based Workflow**: Autonomous agents generate, refactor, review, test, and automate browser and terminal tasks
- **Multi-Agent Management**: Orchestrate multiple agents simultaneously via dedicated Manager View for complex workflows
- **Model Flexibility**: Support for Gemini 2.0 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and OpenAI GPT models
- **End-to-End Automation**: Agents directly access editor, terminal, and browser for autonomous implementation
- **Artifact Generation**: Produces verifiable artifacts including task lists, plans, screenshots, code diffs, and browser logs
- **Continuous Learning**: Agents build knowledge base from past sessions to improve future collaboration
- **Trust & Transparency**: Every agent action documented with human-readable artifacts
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux

## Pricing

Anti-gravity is currently available for **free** in public preview with generous rate limits for Gemini 2.0 Pro and multi-agent orchestration. No paid tier has been announced yet.

This makes it a compelling alternative to paid competitors like Cursor ($20/month) and Windsurf ($15/month), offering unique features like browser automation and verifiable artifact generation at no cost.
