# Jules

Jules is Google's autonomous AI coding agent that works asynchronously in secure Google Cloud VMs. You assign coding tasks such as bug fixes, test writing, or feature implementation, and Jules executes them independently, providing production-ready pull requests.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous Autonomous Agent**: Works independently in secure cloud VMs while you focus on other tasks
- **GitHub Integration**: Tight integration with GitHub for creating, updating, and managing pull requests
- **Multimodal Support**: Interact using natural language instructions with visual outputs
- **Code Critique**: Advanced features for code quality analysis
- **Automated Testing**: Generates and runs automated tests for web applications
- **Audio Changelogs**: Summarizes recent commits in audio format
- **No Local Setup**: Runs entirely in the cloud with no local installation required

## Pricing

Jules offers three pricing tiers:

- **Free**: Up to 15 daily tasks and 3 concurrent tasks
- **Google AI Pro**: $19.99/month - 5x free tier limits (75 daily tasks, 15 concurrent)
- **Google AI Ultra**: $124.99/month - 20x free tier limits (300 daily tasks, 60 concurrent)

Ideal for large codebase updates, automated PRs, and workflow automation.
